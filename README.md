This is a example for JSSupport in Aurora Editor.
Please note that this code is subject to change and may not be the final version.

To run the "tests" you can run:
```bash
swift JSSupport.swift
```

It should print:
```plain
API Test Message: AuroraEditor.api using evaluate...
API Test Message: api using respond()
API Test:
 Function: func
 Parameters: ["some": value, "dict": ionary]
JS Error: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.should.fail')
Tests completed succesfully.
```

This doesn't seem like much, but it's a good start to support JavaScript in Aurora Editor.
